# SecureTransfer
Secure File Transfer System
A secure file transfer system using SSH and SFTP protocols to ensure safe and encrypted file transfers between devices.

## Project Overview
This project provides a solution for securely transferring files over a network using SSH (Secure Shell) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). It leverages the paramiko library to handle the SSH connections and file transfer operations.

## Features
Secure Connections: Uses SSH for establishing a secure connection between the client and the server.
File Transfer: Supports uploading files from the local system to a remote server securely.
Authentication: Supports password-based authentication. Future versions may include SSH key-based authentication.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for connection and file transfer errors.
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
paramiko library

## Installation
### 1- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureFileTransfer.git
cd SecureFileTransfer
```

### 2- Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install paramiko
```

## Usage
To use this system, configure the hostname, port, username, password, local_path, and remote_path variables in the secure_transfer.py script. Then run the script to transfer files securely.

### Security Considerations
Passwords: Avoid hardcoding passwords in the script. Use environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive information.
SSH Keys: Consider using SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords for enhanced security.
Encryption: Ensure that the server's SSH configuration is set up to use strong encryption algorithms.


### Future Enhancements
Add support for SSH key-based authentication.
Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for easier use.
Include more comprehensive logging and monitoring features.
Add support for bi-directional file transfers.
